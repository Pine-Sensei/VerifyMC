  # VerifyMC v1.5.1 Release Notes

  ## Bug Fixes

  - Aligned password regex default with AuthMe (changed from ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,16}$ to ^[!-~]{5,30}$), fixing registration failures when passwords contain special characters or exceed 16 chars
  - Fixed hashed password being passed to AuthMe during manual approval (now skipped, admin uses /api/change-password instead)
  - Fixed MysqlUserDao not hashing passwords (now consistent with FileUserDao)
  - Fixed plugin reload (/vmc reload) causing other plugins ClassLoader to close by replacing disable/enable with safe config-only hot reload

  ## Security Improvements

  - Token generation now uses SecureRandom instead of Math.random()
  - Admin password comparison uses constant-time method to prevent timing attacks
  - Email notification thread set to daemon to prevent blocking server shutdown

  ## i18n and UX

  - Hardcoded 'Username already exists' message replaced with i18n support
  - Added reload success/failure/theme-changed messages in both Chinese and English
  - QuestionnaireService now supports config hot reload via /vmc reload
